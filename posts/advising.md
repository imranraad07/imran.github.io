If you're interested in joining my research team, please reach out to me at imranm@mst.edu. In your email, include a brief introduction, interests and attach your CV (if you can). I am currently recruiting students at all levels, from undergraduate, masters to graduate. If you don't hear back from me within a week, feel free to send a follow-up message as things can get busy. 

If you are already a student at Missouri S&T, feel free to email me to discuss potential research opportunities.
